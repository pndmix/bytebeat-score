# bytebeat-score
This is a CLI *bytebeat* sound application with python3. Bytebeat is algorithmic sound generated from one line of code.

## Dependencies install
- numpy
- pyaudio

~~~bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## Usage
### limitations for bytebeat formula
| limitation | operator |
| --- | --- |
| usable variable | t |
| mathematical operators | +, -, *, /, %, (, ), ** |
| bitwise operators | <<, >>, &, \|, ^, ~ |
| relational operators | <, <=, >, >=, !=, == |

The above *operators* are enough for combining good sound formulas. In addition, support for two notations *infix* and *postfix*.

### play sawtooth wave
~~~bash
$ python bytebeat.py "t"

Sampling rate: 8000 Hz, Playback time: 30 sec
~~~
It's very simple formula with t, enjoy the sound by only this.  
**Note**: enclose bytebeat characters in double quotes (e.g. "t|t\*2")

### play and score melody
~~~bash
$ python bytebeat.py "t*((3+(t>>10&5))*(5+(3&t>>14)))>>(t>>8&3)" --score

Sampling rate: 8000 Hz, Playback time: 30 sec
Scoring now ... done.
~~~
Use score option, save this sound and a score file in [./scores](./scores) directory. More example sounds in [./scores/examples](./scores/examples) directory.  
**Note**: can be set the sound filename as score option's argument (e.g. ./scores/melody.wav)

### postfix notation a.k.a "Reverse Polish Notation"
~~~bash
$ python bytebeat.py "t 10 >> 5 & 3 + t 14 >> 3 & 5 + * t * t 8 >> 3 & >>" --postfix
~~~
Use postfix option, can write formula in postfix notation. This formula is the same as the above section.

### optional commands
| option | feature |
| --- | --- |
| -h, --help | show this help message |
| -p, --postfix | postfix notation |
| -r, --rate | set sampling rate[Hz] |
| -t, --time | set playback time[seconds] |
| -s, --score | write bytebeat sound in wav |
